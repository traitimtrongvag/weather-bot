# Weather Bot

Weather Bot is a simple bot that helps you check current weather information and forecasts for cities worldwide. The bot uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and provides information in Vietnamese.

## Features

- **Current weather**: Get current weather information for a specific city.
- **Weather forecast**: Get a 5-day weather forecast for a specific city.
- **Set default city**: Set a default city so you don't need to enter the city name each time you check the weather.

## Usage

1. **Start**: Send the `/start` command to begin using the bot.
2. **Current weather**: Send `/weather <city name>` to view current weather. If you've set a default city, just send `/weather`.
3. **Weather forecast**: Send `/forecast <city name>` to view the 5-day forecast. If you've set a default city, just send `/forecast`.
4. **Set default city**: Send `/setcity <city name>` to set your default city.
